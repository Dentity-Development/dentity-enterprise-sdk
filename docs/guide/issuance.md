# Issuance of Verifiable Credentials

The process of issuing credentials involves the creation of Verifiable Credentials, which are securely stored in the subject's wallet, commonly referred to as the holder.

In our platform, we distinguish between two types of issuances, each fulfilling a distinct purpose:

- Direct issuance
- Issuance with consent

**Direct issuance** allows issuing parties to sign a verifiable credential without needed user interaction and binding properties. In this case, the issued credential is returned to the issuer in the response and can be sent to the user directly.

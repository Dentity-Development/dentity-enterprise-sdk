# Introduction

## Build the future of identity

Trinsic is a cloud-native, web5-native infrastructure for building IDtech products across a variety of use cases, industries, and geographies. Products built on Trinsic inherit features such as user-centricity, interoperability, and decentralization out of the box. We strive to make these concepts easy to understand and use.

We’re glad you’re here. 
We’ve been focused on providing an exceptional developer experience for decentralized identity since our beginnings in 2019. 
Today, we power many of the most successful decentralized identity products. 
As you explore our documentation, we’d love your feedback through our Slack community, the chat bubble on the page, or email. 
And if you want to complain (or say nice things) to the CEO, feel free to email me (Riley at trinsic.id).

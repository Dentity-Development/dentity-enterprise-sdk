# Introduction

## Build the future of identity

Welcome to Trinsic, the leading infrastructure for building identity products based on identity wallets and verifiable credentials. We work with teams building IDtech products across myriad use cases, industries, and geographies.

Trinsic is a cloud-native, web5-native developer platform, which means your product will inherit features such as user-centricity, interoperability, and decentralization out of the box. We strive to make these concepts easy to understand and use. 

We’re glad you’re here. We’ve been developer-focused since our beginnings in 2019, and now power many of the most successful decentralized identity products. As you explore our documentation, we’d love your feedback through our Slack community, the chat bubble on the page, or [email](mailto:support@trinsic.id). And if you want to complain (or say nice things) to the CEO, feel free to email me (Riley at trinsic.id).

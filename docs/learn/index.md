# What is Trinsic?
![Trust Triangle](/_static/images/trust-triangle.png)

Trinsic makes it easy to issue, verify, and manage verifiable credentials.

Verifiable Credentials transform credentials, licenses, passes, and certificates into a W3C standard format that can be exchanged digitally and verified instantly. Unlike a paper document or html form, when information from a verifiable credential is shared, it can be instantly proven to be authentic.

Credentials can be used to do authentication and authorization, but they can also be used to prove information about anyone. 

We'll walk through the building blocks of how this is possible.

Take advantage of our SDK to embed issuance and verifications into apps with your own branding. 

Embed credential issuance and verification directly into your applications.

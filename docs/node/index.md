# The Trinsic Javascript / Typescript Node SDK

The Trinsic Node/Web SDK makes it easy to interact with the Trinsic API from any backend javascript application. The most recent version of the library can be found on npm. You can find the SDKs source on [Github](https://github.com/trinsic-id/sdk/tree/main/web). The @trinsic/trinsic package comes with Typescript bindings.
## Installation
Install the package for Node from [npmjs.com <small>:material-open-in-new:</small>](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@trinsic/trinsic){target=_blank}

=== "Install"
    ```bash
    npm i @trinsic/trinsic
    ```

## Javascript


To import the Trinsic SDK:
```js
import { TrinsicService } from "@trinsic/trinsic";
```

For CommonJS:
```typescript
let { TrinsicService } = require("@trinsic/trinsic");
```

You must instantiate the trinsic service first:
```js
const trinsicService = new TrinsicService({
    /** Trinsic API endpoint. Defaults to `prod.trinsic.cloud` */
    serverEndpoint: "prod.trinsic.cloud",
    /** Trinsic API port; defaults to `443` */
    serverPort: 443,
    /** Whether TLS is enabled between SDK and Trinsic API; defaults to `true` */
    serverUseTls: true,
    /** Authentication token for SDK calls; defaults to empty string (unauthenticated) */
    authToken: "<Your auth token>"
});
```

Now you can use the SDK:
```js
const newWallet = await trinsicService.wallet().createWallet();
console.log(JSON.stringify(newWallet, null, 4));
```

You can find all the SDK methods documented [here](/reference/)

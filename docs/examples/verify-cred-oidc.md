# Request Verifiable Credential using OIDC

!!! note "Source code for this example"

    [https://github.com/trinsic-id/sdk/tree/main/examples/verify-cred-oidc](https://github.com/trinsic-id/sdk/tree/main/examples/verify-cred-oidc)

### Overview

In this example we'll setup a basic webpage and configure it to request a Verifiable Credential using OIDC protocol in a popup window. You can also configure OIDC using a browser redirect or embedded iframe, but this is beyond the scope of this example.
We will also configure a backend API that will take the shared credential from the client and verify it using Trinsic's API. This step is optional, you can
use any third-party service to verify the validity of the credential since these credentials are globally verifiable.


### Setup our demo

Let's create a new npm project

```
npm init
```

and add our dependencies

```
npm install express @trinsic/trinsic
```
### Import and configure services

Create new file named `index.js` at the root of the repo and configure the services.

```js
import express from 'express';
import { TrinsicService } from "@trinsic/trinsic";

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

const trinsic = new TrinsicService({
    authToken: "<AUTH_TOKEN>",
});
```

??? note "How to obtain an Auth Token"

    You can obtain auth token from the [Dashboard <small>:material-open-in-new:</small>](https://dashboard.trinsic.id){targer=_blank} by clicking on the View Auth Token in the Home page.

### Create Verify Credential API

Let's configure Express to create an endpoint for verification served at `/api/verify`. Next, we'll use Trinsic's SDK to verify the credential from the request body and return the verification result as a respoinse to the API call.

```js
app.post('/api/verify', async (req, res) => {

    const verificationResponse = await trinsic.verifier().verifyCredential({
        credential: JSON.stringify(req.body),
    });

    res.send(verificationResponse);
});
```

Add the rest of the express configuration where we will serve static files and run the server at a port of your choice.

```js
// Serve static files from the 'public' folder
app.use(express.static(process.cwd()));

// Catch-all to return index.html for any other request
app.get('*', (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(process.cwd(), 'index.html'));
});

// Start the server
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
  console.log(`Access the demo page at http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
```

# Example web page

Create a new file named `index.html` at the root of the repo and reference Trinsic's SDK.

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@trinsic/trinsic@1.11.3-pre.13/dist/trinsic.min.js"></script>
```

Let's add additional script to register a button click event that will start the process of requesting a Verifiable Credential from the holder.
Make sure to edit the `ecosystem` and `schema` to match the ecosystem and schema you would like to request.

```html
<button id="verifyButton">Request Verifiable Credential</button>

<script>
    const { ConnectClient } = trinsic;
    const client = new ConnectClient();

    document.getElementById("verifyButton").addEventListener("click", async () => {
        const presentationResponse = await client.requestVerifiableCredential({
            ecosystem: "did-hack",
            schema: "https://schema.trinsic.cloud/did-hack/attendance-credential",
        });

        console.log(presentationResponse);

        // call API to verify credential
        const response = await fetch("/api/verify", {
            method: "POST",
            headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
            body: JSON.stringify(presentationResponse.vp_token),
        });
        const data = await response.json();

        console.log(data);
    });
</script>
```

### Run the demo

Run the demo by executing the following command in the terminal

```
node index.js
```

The project should run and be accessible at [http://localhost:3000 <small>:material-open-in-new:</small>](http://localhost:3000){target=_blank}.

Enjoy! ðŸ‘‹

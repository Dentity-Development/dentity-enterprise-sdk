# Request Identity Document Verification in browser

!!! note "Source code for this example"

    [https://github.com/trinsic-id/sdk/tree/main/examples/idv-browser](https://github.com/trinsic-id/sdk/tree/main/examples/idv-browser)

## Overview

In this example we'll setup a basic webpage and configure it to initiate an identity verification of a government identity document using Trinsic Connect.

We will also configure a backend API that will set up the integration with the SDK and handle the creation and retrieval of the identity verification session (IDV session).

Let's take a look at the data flow between the different actors and components in a usual IDV verification with Trinsic Connect:

</center>

### Typical Flow

A typical Trinsic Connect flow generally goes as follows:

1. Create a verification session using the [`CreateSession`](/reference/services/connect-service/#create-session){target=_blank} SDK call
    1. Store the session `id` somewhere in your backend; this will be used to reference the session in further SDK calls
2. Send the `client_token` you received in the response to `CreateSession` to your frontend
3. Begin the flow on your frontend by calling the `identityVerification()` method on `ConnectClient`, passing the `client_token` as an argument
    1. This method returns a promise that will resolve when the flow is completed
4. Await the promise returned by `identityVerification()`
5. Ping your backend to trigger it to process the verification results
6. Fetch the session using the [`GetSession`](/reference/services/connect-service/#get-session){target=_blank} SDK call from your backend, and process the results


If the flow is successful, the session's `state` will be `IDV_SUCCESS`, and the resultant identity data will be available in two forms:

- In the `result_vp` field of the `session`
    - This is a [Verifiable Presentation <small>:material-open-in-new:</small>](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#presentations){target=_blank}, and is cryptographically verifiable.
- In the `normalized_government_id_data` field of the `verification` within the `session`
    - This is a strongly-typed representation of the data in `result_vp`, but it is not in the form of a Verifiable Presentation.


If the flow is unsucessful, the session's `state` will be `IDV_FAILED`, and the reason for failure will be present in the `session.fail_code` field.

## Setup our demo

Let's create a new npm project:

```
npm init -y
```

Add our dependencies:

```
npm install express @trinsic/trinsic
```

Create new file named `index.js` at the root of the repo and configure the services.

```js
import express from "express";
import path from "path";
import { TrinsicService, VerificationType } from "@trinsic/trinsic";

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

const trinsic = new TrinsicService({
    authToken: "<AUTH_TOKEN>",
});
```

!!! note "How to obtain an Auth Token"

    Assuming you are part of the Trinsic Connect beta, you can obtain auth token from the [Trinsic Studio <small>:material-open-in-new:</small>](https://idv.connect.trinsic.cloud/wallet/relying-party/configure){targer=_blank}.

## Create IDV Session API

Let's configure Express to create two endpoints for creating a new IDV session (served at `/api/create-session`) and retrieving an IDV session (served at `/api/get-session`). We'll use Trinsic's SDK to generate the IDV session for a government document verification and then retrieve it to read its results.

```js
app.post("/api/create-session", async (req, res) => {
    const verifyResponse = await trinsic.connection().createSession({
        verifications: [{ type: VerificationType.GOVERNMENT_ID }],
    });

    res.json(verifyResponse.session);
});

app.post("/api/get-session", async (req, res) => {
    var response = await trinsic.connection().getSession({
        idvSessionId: req.body.idvSessionId,
    });

    req.json(response);
});
```

Add the rest of the express configuration where we will serve static files and run the server at a port of your choice.

```js
// Serve static files from the 'public' folder
app.use(express.static(process.cwd()));

// Catch-all to return index.html for any other request
app.get("*", (req, res) => {
    res.sendFile(path.join(process.cwd(), "index.html"));
});

// Start the server
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
    console.log(`Access the demo page at http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
```

## Example web page

Create a new file named `index.html` at the root of the repo and reference Trinsic's SDK.

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@trinsic/trinsic@1.13.0/dist/trinsic.min.js"></script>
```

Let's add additional script to register a button click event that will start the process of identity verification with Trinsic Connect.

```html
<button id="verifyButton" class="btn btn-primary">Start Verification</button>

<script>
    // initialize the credential handler polyfill when the page loads

    document.getElementById("verifyButton").addEventListener("click", async () => {
            const { ConnectClient } = trinsic;
            const client = new ConnectClient();

            // 1. Get a valid session from the backend
            const createResponse = await fetch("/api/create-session", {
                method: "POST",
            });
            const session = await createResponse.json();

            console.log(session);

            // 2. Perform identity verification
            const idvResponse = await client.identityVerification(
                session.clientToken
            );

            console.log(await idvResponse.json());

            // 3. Check the verification status
            const getResponse = await fetch("/api/get-session", {
                method: "POST",
                headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
                body: JSON.stringify({ sessionId: session.id }),
            });
            const idvResult = await getResponse.json();

            console.log(idvResult);
        });
</script>
```

## Run the demo

Run the demo by executing the following command in the terminal

```
node index.js
```

The project should run and be accessible at [http://localhost:3000 <small>:material-open-in-new:</small>](http://localhost:3000){target=_blank}.

Enjoy! ðŸ‘‹

# Welcome to Trinsic
Trinsic serves three types of users.

Our technology helps people prove things about themselves with technology instead of paper. 

We help developers protect customer data from the start of their project.

We enable enterprises to shift their data exchanges from paper to an entirely digital medium.

Trinsic gives your users a single digital identity that works equally well in person and online. People and organizations can message you, send you information, and authenticate who you are. 

It's theirs to own and control. 

Trinsic's SDK makes it easy to add this functionality to your product. 

Let's get started.  

## Product Concepts

Trinsic is divided into two sections. Trinsic Core, which deals with credentials, passes, and wallets. And Trinsic Ecosystems, which manages things like Templates and Ecosystems.

### Trinsic Core

**Credentials**
Credentials are containers that hold information about you. 

**Passes**
Passes are generated from credentials or issued directly. They are specific to a scenario and only include the information necessary to fulfill a verifier's request.

**Wallets**
A credential storage system encrypted and controlled by keys located on one or more devices. 

### Trinsic Ecosystem
_**Coming soon.**_

While credentials, passes, and wallets are the only thing an individual using your app might need to interact with, there are a few more concepts for the Provider. Templates and Ecosystems. 
Verifiers and holders want a way to know the issuer is a legitimate entity they trust. 

Holders want to know that the verifier they're sending a pass to is someone they trust.

We introduce the concept of a trust registry. 

**Credential Template**
Describes a credential using its name and attribute types

**Pass Template**
Describes a pass using the attribute types and queries on those attributes

**Trust Registry**
Shows a list of authorized issuers and verifiers and the templates they're authorized to use.

### Issue and verify universally-accepted digital credentials.
Online it's impossible to prove your legal name, age, or anything else about your identity - but in person, it's easy as long as you have the right paperwork.

Trinsic provides an SDK to issue and verify universally-accepted digital credentials so that anywhere people go online or in-person, they can simply tap their phone, prove who they are, and get what they need.

## Quickstart 
Get up and running in the language of your choice or interact with Trinsic through your terminal.

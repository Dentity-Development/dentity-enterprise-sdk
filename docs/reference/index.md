# Overview

If you are ready to begin integrating the SDK, make sure you have an SDK installed and configured. You can install each SDK by following the instructions in each page under **Build** in the sidebar.

When using the SDK, you can pass parameters to the default service constructors and use the provided methods to set different active profiles.

## Authorization

See our [security](../learn/security.md) section for more information on how we have implemented wallet authentication and authorization.

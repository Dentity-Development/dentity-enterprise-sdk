# Template Service

## Credential Templates

Credential Templates are json templates that help issuers save context when issuing credentials. 

When issuing a credential through Trinsic, it's as simple as adding the attributes to the credential template and then issuing it. 

These credential templates can be shared between issuers in an ecosystem. 

### Contexts

A template is a saved JSON-LD schema that is used to define/create credentials and verification.

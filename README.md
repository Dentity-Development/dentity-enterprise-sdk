## Introduction

Welcome to Trinsic, the proof-of-anything platform. We are the leading developer platform for implementing [verifiable credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) and [decentralized identifiers](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) - emerging web standards for building next-gen digital identity systems.

Learn how to issue and verify universally-accepted digital credentials so that anywhere people go online or in-person, they can simply tap their phone, prove who they are, and get what they need.

## Getting Started

Check our our [documentation](https://docs.trinsic.id) to learn about Trinsic, work through a basic implementation, plan a full integration, and learn about our tools you can use.

## Example Implementations

Check out our [dedicated repository with various examples](https://github.com/trinsic-id/sdk-examples/) and use cases for different platforms and languages.

## Available SDKs

## Updating Proto-Generated Files

There is a python script which does the proto file generation for all languages (except dotnet and rust) in the `devops` folder. dotnet and rust are handled well by their respective build systems. You will need all language-specific plugins configured on your machine.

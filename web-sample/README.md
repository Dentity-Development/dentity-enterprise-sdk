## Installation

First install packages with 
```
npm install
```

Then run the build which includes running webpack into a bundle that can be used with all the samples

```
npm run build
```

## Run the Samples

To run the samples use 

```
npm start
```

this will start a http server on `localhost:8080` which you can go to in the browser and run the samples. Other sub samples can be run by adding the name of the sample to the url path i.e. `localhost:8080/VaccinationSample`
